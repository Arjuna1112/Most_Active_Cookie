# most-active-cookie
Process a cookie log and return the most active cookie for a specific day

## Tech

- Java 11, Spring Boot (framework), Maven (build tool)

## Requirements

Given a cookie log file in the following format:

~~~
cookie,timestamp
AtY0laUfhglK3lC7,2018-12-09T14:19:00+00:00
SAZuXPGUrfbcn5UA,2018-12-09T10:13:00+00:00

4sMM2LxV07bPJzwf,2018-12-07T23:30:00+00:00
~~~

- Write a command line program to process the log file and return the most active cookie for a specific day. 
- Include a -f parameter for the filename to process and a -d parameter to specify the date.

e.g. weâ€™d execute your program like this to obtain the most active cookie for 9th Dec 2018.

~~~
$ ./[command] -f cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-09
~~~

And it would write to stdout:

~~~
AtY0laUfhglK3lC7
~~~

We define the most active cookie as one seen in the log the most times during a given day.

## Assumptions

- If multiple cookies meet that criteria, please return all of them on separate lines.
- Only use additional libraries for testing, logging and cli-parsing.
- You can assume -d parameter takes date in UTC time zone.
- You have enough memory to store the contents of the whole file.
- Cookies in the log file are sorted by timestamp (most recent occurrence is the first line of the file).

##Approach
- Option 1 : 
  - Using File reader to read file until we get selected date
  - Once we get selected date, store cookie with count in HashMap
  - Sort hash map based on value and print cookies with most count
- Option 2 :
  - Use CsvToBeanBuilder to convert file into object
  - Fetch cookies of input date using binary search
  - Prepare map with cookies and count, finally sort and print
- Option 3:
  - Use CsvToBeanBuilder to convert file into object
  - Use Java 8 stream concepts to print cookies with most count

## Flow
- The flow stars at CookieRunner class, it's initialized by using CookieConfig class.

## Build

- Go to directory: most_active_cookie
- Using Maven to build and package source code into a jar file:
~~~
mvn clean package
~~~

[Build Successful](Build_Success.png)

## Run

- Still stand at the directory: most_active_cookie
- Run the compiled jar file:

~~~
java -jar target\cookie-filter-version-SNAPSHOT.jar -f csv-file-path -d selected-date
~~~

- Example:

~~~
java -jar target\cookie-filter-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -f src\logs\cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-09
~~~
